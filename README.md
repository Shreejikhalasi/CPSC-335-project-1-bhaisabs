Implementing Lawnmower and Alternating Algorithms

  In order to solve the Alternating disk problem, we implemented two algorithms known as the 
Lawnmower and Alternating Algorithms respectively.  Given a list of evenly weighted binary 
elements (an even amount of black or white disks), sort the list where all the black disks 
are on the left and all the white disks are on the right.  The Lawnmower Algorithm works its 
way from left to right and then from right to left, making swaps as necessary.  The Alternating 
Algorithm works its way from left to right, alternating the sets that make up pairs, while 
making swaps as necessary.
